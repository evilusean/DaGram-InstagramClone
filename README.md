Flutter/Firebase, Responsive design-Works on iOS, Android and HTML! </br>
flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer html #use to run code in main.dart </br>
Still can not emulate on iOS/Android, haxm issue with android studio 1 1/2 days wasted </br>
HTML chrome/Windows works for debugging now </br>
Emulation works, requires haxm 7.6.5 NOT 7.8 to work with flutter/android studio emulation, manual install to fix </br>
To get access to emulator, first run emulator and Run -> Run without Debugging </br>
