Flutter/Firebase, Responsive design-Works on iOS, Android and HTML!
flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer html #use to run code in main.dart
Still can not emulate on iOS/Android, haxm issue with android studio 1 1/2 days wasted
HTML chrome/Windows works for debugging now
Emulation works, requires haxm 7.6.5 NOT 7.8 to work with flutter/android studio emulation, manual install to fix
